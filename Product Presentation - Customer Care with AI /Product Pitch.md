This screen represents basic positive use cases about the workflows of the call center call handling by the agent and accomplishing simple tasks through self service portal with the help of GenAI chatBot / copilot. Including these, complex use cases can also be handled gracefully with the help of GenAI Engine.
And that is exactly the core part of the solution to such use cases, proposed in this presentation.

The GenAI engine being the main solution, we divide it into 3 different modules based on the different functionality supported by them:
GenAI Co-Pilot for Users
GenAI Co-Pilot for Backoffice
GenAI Marketing Bot

These modules have access to different levels of data based on their functionalities and their users.

To represent the high level roadmap of this transformation journey, we have considered two major releases per year.
Having said that, it should be noted that the minor releases will still be available delivering the partial usable functionalities to gauge the user response and accommodate changes in the further releases i.e. these releases will follow the Agile methodology keeping the users and other stakeholders at the center.
The items shown under the releases are displayed as per their perceived priorities and are in fact the features representing a vast functionality within individual feature.

The Mckinsey report statement: https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai-telcos-key-to-personalized-customer-experiences/103050378 
NOMI case study: https://hbr.org/2023/08/using-ai-to-build-stronger-connections-with-customers

Some of the stats here are based on some publicly available reports as mentioned above or some case studies from different domains/organizations. Additionally based on the logical evaluations, we have also estimated some of the stats that will help achieve the final goals for ‘Organization A’.
